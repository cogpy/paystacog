# OpenCog Orchestration Engine for PaystackOSS

This repository implements an **OpenCog-inspired orchestration engine** that provides intelligent automation and management for the PaystackOSS GitHub organization. The system uses artificial intelligence principles from the OpenCog framework to make smart decisions about repository management, health monitoring, and organizational optimization.

## üß† What is OpenCog Orchestration?

OpenCog is an artificial general intelligence (AGI) framework that emphasizes:
- **Goal-directed behavior selection**
- **Context-aware decision making** 
- **Multi-objective optimization**
- **Adaptive learning from outcomes**
- **Intelligent action planning**

Our orchestration engine applies these principles to GitHub organization management, creating an intelligent system that can:
- Automatically analyze repository health and trends
- Select appropriate maintenance actions based on context
- Prioritize tasks using utility theory
- Learn and adapt from execution outcomes
- Generate intelligent insights and recommendations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The OpenCog orchestration system consists of several key components:

### Core Workflows

1. **OpenCog Orchestrator** (`.github/workflows/opencog-orchestrator.yml`)
   - Main orchestration engine that runs hourly
   - Implements action selection and execution pipeline
   - Supports manual triggering with different action types

2. **Health Monitor** (`.github/workflows/opencog-health-monitor.yml`)
   - Daily health checks and monitoring
   - Threshold-based alerting system
   - Automated issue creation for critical problems

### Intelligence Components

1. **Action Selector** (`opencog_action_selector.py`)
   - Analyzes organizational context using GitHub API
   - Applies OpenCog-style utility calculation for action prioritization
   - Supports multiple action types: analyze, sync, health_check, security_scan

2. **Action Executor** (`opencog_executor.py`)
   - Executes selected actions with error handling and recovery
   - Implements context-aware adaptation during execution
   - Tracks execution outcomes for learning

3. **Intelligence Reporter** (`opencog_reporter.py`)
   - Pattern recognition in execution data
   - Adaptive insights generation
   - Context-aware recommendations using OpenCog planning principles

### Supporting Systems

- **Health Dashboard Creator**: Generates visual health dashboards
- **Threshold Checker**: Monitors key metrics against configurable thresholds  
- **Profile Updater**: Intelligently updates organization profile based on insights
- **Badge Updater**: Maintains health status badges

## üéØ Key Features

### Intelligent Action Selection

The system uses OpenCog-inspired algorithms to:
- Analyze the current state of all repositories in the organization
- Calculate utility scores for different possible actions
- Select the most beneficial actions based on organizational goals
- Adapt priorities based on current context (e.g., boost security actions if vulnerabilities found)

### Context-Aware Execution

Actions are executed with full context awareness:
- Repository health metrics influence execution strategies
- Failed actions trigger adaptive recovery mechanisms
- Execution patterns are learned and optimized over time

### Comprehensive Health Monitoring

The system continuously monitors:
- **Repository Activity**: Tracks which repos are actively maintained
- **Documentation Quality**: Analyzes description completeness and README presence  
- **Security Posture**: Reviews security settings and recommendations
- **Language Distribution**: Tracks technology stack evolution
- **Contribution Patterns**: Monitors community engagement

### Automated Insights & Recommendations

Using OpenCog pattern recognition:
- Identifies trends and anomalies in repository data
- Generates actionable recommendations for improvement
- Prioritizes recommendations using multi-objective optimization
- Creates automated issues for critical problems requiring human attention

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Automatic Operation

The orchestration engine runs automatically:
- **Hourly**: Full orchestration analysis and actions
- **Daily**: Comprehensive health monitoring and reporting

### Manual Triggering

You can manually trigger workflows:

```bash
# Trigger main orchestration with specific action type
gh workflow run opencog-orchestrator.yml -f action_type=security_scan -f target_repos=all

# Trigger health monitoring with specific check type
gh workflow run opencog-health-monitor.yml -f check_type=comprehensive
```

### Viewing Results

Results are available through:
- **GitHub Actions**: View execution logs and artifacts
- **Health Dashboard**: Visual dashboard created after each run
- **Organization Profile**: Automatically updated with latest insights
- **Issues**: Automatically created for critical problems

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Health Thresholds

Configure monitoring thresholds in `.github/config/health_thresholds.yml`:

```yaml
thresholds:
  success_rate:
    excellent: 95.0
    good: 80.0
    warning: 60.0
    critical: 59.9
```

### Action Parameters

Customize action behavior through workflow inputs and environment variables.

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Health Status Levels

- **üü¢ Excellent**: All metrics above excellent thresholds
- **üü° Good**: All metrics above good thresholds  
- **üü† Warning**: Some metrics below good thresholds
- **üî¥ Critical**: One or more metrics below critical thresholds

### Automated Alerting

The system automatically:
- Creates GitHub issues for critical problems
- Updates health status badges
- Generates detailed reports and recommendations
- Tracks resolution progress

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Action Types

The orchestration engine supports multiple action types:
- `analyze`: Comprehensive organizational analysis
- `sync`: Synchronize organization profile and metadata
- `health_check`: Focus on repository health metrics
- `security_scan`: Security-focused analysis and recommendations

### Extending the System

To add new orchestration capabilities:

1. **Add Action Type**: Extend action selector with new action type logic
2. **Implement Executor**: Add execution logic in the executor
3. **Update Reporter**: Enhance insights and recommendations
4. **Configure Thresholds**: Add relevant health thresholds

### Integration Options

The system can be extended to integrate with:
- External monitoring systems (Slack, email notifications)
- Issue tracking systems  
- Security scanning tools
- Documentation generation systems

## ü§ñ OpenCog Principles in Action

Our implementation demonstrates several key OpenCog concepts:

### Action Selection & Planning
- **Goal-Oriented**: Actions are selected based on organizational health goals
- **Context-Sensitive**: Current repository state influences action prioritization
- **Multi-Objective**: Balances multiple competing objectives (security, maintenance, growth)

### Adaptive Intelligence
- **Learning**: System adapts based on execution outcomes and patterns
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends and anomalies in repository data
- **Predictive**: Anticipates maintenance needs and potential issues
